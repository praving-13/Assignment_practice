calculate probability

# probability from Z=0 to lower bound
double_prob = erf( (x1-mu) / (sigma*sqrt(2)) )
p_lower = double_prob/2
print(f'\n Lower Bound: {round(p_lower,4)}')

# probability from Z=0 to upper bound
double_prob = erf( (x2-mu) / (sigma*sqrt(2)) )
p_upper = double_prob/2
print(f'\n Upper Bound: {round(p_upper,4)}')
